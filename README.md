# SoloTugg
Allows your dog to play tug of war with their favorite toy without the need for a person to hold the other end.  

We all love our dogs, and to keep them happy even while youâ€™re away we are introducing SoloTugg! Solotugg Provides your dog with entertainment &amp; exercise without taking away from your busy day.

SoloTugg Team:

Brian Balfour & Mallory Stein


We are both self starters, entrepreneurs and dog lovers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who are constantly trying to make our busy daily lives a little bit easier. Our dog Cookie is very important to us, but we found ourselves not being able to play her favorite game Tug-of-war as much as she wanted too. So we put our creative minds to work!
SoloTugg was born and Cookie loved it, so did our friends' dogs.  That's when we knew we wanted to share this with every other tug-loving dog out there!
